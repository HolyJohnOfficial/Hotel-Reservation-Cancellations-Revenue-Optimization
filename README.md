# Hotel-Reservation-Cancellations-Revenue-Optimization

## Introduction  
Hotel reservations tell a fascinating story—not just of guests checking in, but also of how hotels manage risk, cancellations, and revenue.  
This project explores **reservation cancellations between 2015–2017**, uncovering seasonal spikes and their impact on revenue.  

A key finding:  
> In just July and August of 2016, cancellations cost hotels **over $1 million** in lost revenue.  

This analysis highlights **why data-driven strategies are crucial** for the hospitality industry and how hotels can optimize performance even in the face of uncertainty.

## Methodology  

### Data Collection & Preparation  
- Source: Reservation data (2015–2017) from *Splendor Analytics Academy*.  
- Tools: **Microsoft Excel** (Get & Transform / Power Query).  
- Key variables analyzed:  
  - Cancellation rates  
  - Booking lead times  
  - Average Daily Rates (ADR)  

### Approach  
1. Tracked **monthly cancellation patterns** to detect seasonal peaks.  
2. Compared **advance bookings (>30 days)** with **short-lead bookings (0–30 days)**.  
3. Measured the effect on **ADR and revenue**.  

### Dashboard  
- Built an interactive dashboard in Excel/BI tools.  
- Visualized cancellations, ADR trends, and revenue loss with combined line/bar charts.  
- Highlighted key insights for quick interpretation.

## Analysis  

### Cancellation Trends  
- Peak months: **July (35%)** and **August (34–39%)**.  
- Advance bookings (>30 days) = **38% cancellation rate**.  
- Short-lead bookings (0–30 days) = **20% cancellation rate**.  

### Average Daily Rate (ADR)  
- Short-lead bookings: **$191 ADR** (higher prices, fewer cancellations).  
- Advance bookings: **$169 ADR** (lower prices, more cancellations).  

### Revenue Impact  
- Cancellations in July & August 2016 = **~$1 million lost revenue**.  
- High ADRs were offset by high cancellation rates, eroding profitability.  

---

## Findings  
- Cancellations spike in **July & August**, causing major losses.  
- **Advance bookings** are riskier and cancel more often.  
- **Short-lead bookings** are both more profitable and more reliable.  
- Seasonal demand swings heavily influence revenue outcomes.  

---

## Recommendations  

### Overbooking Strategy  
- Slightly overbook during summer months to offset cancellations.  
- Prioritize reliable, short-lead reservations.  

### Revenue Management  
- Flexible pricing to encourage last-minute bookings.  
- Predictive models to forecast cancellations.  

### Policy Adjustments  
- Stricter cancellation terms during peak months.  
- Offer discounts on **non-refundable rates** to reduce cancellations.  

### Customer Segmentation  
- Identify customer groups with high cancellation rates.  
- Tailor booking policies for different segments.

## Conclusion  
Cancellations aren’t just an inconvenience—they’re a **revenue leakage problem**.  
But with the right strategy, hotels can:  

1. Reduce losses from cancellations,  
2. Improve occupancy reliability, and  
3. Maximize ADR during peak demand.  

This project demonstrates how **data + strategy = smarter revenue management**.
